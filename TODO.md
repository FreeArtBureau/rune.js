## Codebase

### Must

- [ ] Add functions to polygon: http://polyk.ivank.net/?p=demos&d=intersect
- [ ] `scale()` on all shapes
- [ ] masking
- [ ] `textWidth()`

### Nice to have

- [ ] Rewrite with react and flux. Prevent re-drawing all the time.
- [ ] requestAnimationFrame should work in node
- [ ] `stagePos()` on shapes and groups to get absolute position
- [ ] `keypressed`
- [ ] masking / clipping
- [ ] Gradients
- [ ] Debug should have full polygon vectors and anchor vectors
- [ ] Extend color instead of copy/pasting code.
- [ ] Ability to set debug line color and debug circle color
- [ ] Rune.Font plugin
- [ ] whitelist values passed directly to SVG. Throw error if not supported.
- [ ] Default styleable settings
- [ ] SVG parser
