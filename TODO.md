## Codebase

### Must

- [ ] `draw` function
- [ ] `.rotate` with x and y axis
- [ ] Add `copy` function to groups
- [ ] Groups should bubble down changes to children, so all children know their true x and y

### Nice to have 

- [ ] SVG parser

## Documentation

- Different shape types
- The way `.move` works for all polygons and shapes, as well as x, y and translate
- chaining and `.vars`
- Path and `closePath()`. You can have multiple subpaths in one
- rotation
