## Codebase

### Must

- [ ] Colors should `%` if values higher than needed
- [ ] Be able to pass a Color into fill and stroke
- [ ] All `Rune.` constants should be accessible as `r.`

### Nice to have 

- [ ] Default styleable settings
- [ ] Download SVG file (use SVG Crowbar)
- [ ] Groups should bubble down changes to children, so all children know their true x and y
- [ ] SVG parser
- [ ] Framerate
