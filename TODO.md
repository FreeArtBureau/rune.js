## Codebase

### Must

- [ ] Image shapes
- [ ] SVG converter as Chrome plugin
- [ ] Fix error around DOM update and mousemove being off
- [ ] Filters
- [ ] Blend modes
- [ ] Rune.Color should be much faster  
- [ ] Finish Runegen and use for Rune.Font and other plugins
- [ ] masking
- [ ] Gradients
- [ ] `textWidth()`
- [ ] `keypressed`
- [ ] `.contains()` on path
- [ ] `.intersect()` and `intersection()` on polygons

### Nice to have

- [ ] Rewrite with react and flux. Prevent re-drawing all the time.
- [ ] requestAnimationFrame should work in node
- [ ] Debug should have full polygon vectors and anchor vectors
- [ ] Ability to set debug line color and debug circle color
- [ ] SVG parser
