## Codebase

### Must

- [ ] Find a better way to develop modules for Rune.js. Create a small NPM package that can be used to generate the Github and NPM zip, also testing.
- [ ] Use this new package for Rune.Font.js. Rename font.browser to rune.font.js, etc.
- [ ] masking
- [ ] `textWidth()`

### Nice to have

- [ ] Rewrite with react and flux. Prevent re-drawing all the time.
- [ ] requestAnimationFrame should work in node
- [ ] `stagePos()` on shapes and groups to get absolute position
- [ ] `keypressed`
- [ ] masking / clipping
- [ ] Gradients
- [ ] Debug should have full polygon vectors and anchor vectors
- [ ] Extend color instead of copy/pasting code.
- [ ] Ability to set debug line color and debug circle color
- [ ] Rune.Font plugin
- [ ] whitelist values passed directly to SVG. Throw error if not supported.
- [ ] Default styleable settings
- [ ] SVG parser
