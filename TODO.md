## Codebase

### Must

- [ ] Download SVG file
- [ ] Random functions like Processing
- [ ] Singular values should be grayscale colors
- [ ] mouseX and mouseY

### Nice to have 

- [ ] Debug mode with all groups showing borders and all curves showing control points.
- [ ] Groups should bubble down changes to children, so all children know their true x and y
- [ ] SVG parser
- [ ] Framerate
- [ ] frameCount
