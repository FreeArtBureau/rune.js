# rune.js

There is a ton of great JS drawing libraries for the web, and favorites like [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) and [Two.js](https://jonobr1.github.io/two.js/) is a great fit for many projects. However, I have been looking for a library specifically written for the kind of visual design work I do with the students in my [Printing Code](printingcode.runemadsen.com) class, so I decided to write rune.js. 

The main goals of this project is:

- **SVG**. Simplify rendering by only focusing on SVG output. SVG is great for generative design projects that end up as printed products, as well as web-native projects.
- **Simple syntax**.
- **Virtual dom**.
- **Scene Graph**
- **Computational Geometry**
- **Typography**
