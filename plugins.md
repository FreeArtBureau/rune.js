# Plugins

Rune.js extends the core codebase via optional plugins to prevent bloating the core, and to encourage an ecosystem around the basic Rune.js shape objects and their functionality.

Ping me on [@runemadsen](https://www.twitter.com/runemadsen) if you want me to add a plugin. You can also do it yourself and send a [pull request](https://github.com/runemadsen/rune.js/tree/gh-pages).

## Rune.Font

This plugin can load font files and convert them into `Rune.Path` objects. This is great for doing generative typography, or anything else related to accessing font vectors. Works in both the browser and node.

- **Getting started**: See the [plugin README](https://github.com/runemadsen/rune.fonts.js).
- **Examples**: Look at the [Typography section](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/examples/#typography) in the Rune.js examples.

## Rune.Noise

This plugin adds perlin noise functions to Rune.js through a `Rune.Noise` object.

- **Getting started**: See the [plugin README](https://github.com/runemadsen/rune.noise.js).
- **Examples**: Look at the [Randomization section](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/examples/#randomization) in the Rune.js examples.
