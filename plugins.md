# Plugins

Rune.js extends the core codebase via optional plugins to prevent bloating the core, and to encourage an ecosystem around the basic Rune.js shape objects and their functionality.

Ping me on [@runemadsen](https://www.twitter.com/runemadsen) if you want me to add a plugin. You can also do it yourself and send a [pull request](https://github.com/runemadsen/rune.js/tree/gh-pages).

## Rune.Font

A plugin that loads font files and converts them to `Rune.Path` objects. You can see how to use `Rune.Font` under the [Typography section](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/examples/#typography) in the Rune.js examples.
