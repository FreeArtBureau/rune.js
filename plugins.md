# Plugins

Rune.js extends the core codebase via optional plugins to prevent bloating the core, and to encourage an ecosystem around the basic Rune.js shape objects and their functionality.

[See all available Rune.js plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/rune.js)

To add a plugin to this directory, simply add the keyword `rune.js` to your package.json file before publishing.
