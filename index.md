## Getting started

### The stage graph

You can do shit la la

## Shapes

### Basics

All shapes share some common functions. Here's an overview.

#### `.move(x, y, relative)`

This is something to say about this code example. It might be a little crazy, but that's how it is baby.

#### `.rotate(degrees, x, y)`

This is something to say about this code example. It might be a little crazy, but that's how it is baby.

### Rune.Polygon

A polygon is something that you use to do bla bla bla. It can rotate, bla bla bla. Initialize a new polygon without adding to the stage.  It might be a little crazy.

#### `new Rune.Polygon(x, y)`

Initialize a new polygon without adding to the stage.  It might be a little crazy, but that's how it is baby. This is something to say about this code example. It might be a little crazy, but that's how it is baby. This is something to say about this code example. It might be a little crazy, but that's how it is baby.

#### `.lineTo(x, y)`

This is something to say about this code example. It might be a little crazy, but that's how it is baby. This is something to say about this code example. It might be a little crazy, but that's how it is baby. This is something to say about this code example. It might be a little crazy, but that's how it is baby.

This method can be chained.

```
polygon
  .lineTo(10, 15)
  .lineTo(300, 305);
```
